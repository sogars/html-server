Phishing Campaign Stimulation: Cybersecurity Awareness Team
This project aims to simulate a phishing campaign to enhance cybersecurity awareness among employees of "Some Fake Bank." 
By creating realistic email templates and a custom landing page, the project tests the susceptibility of users to phishing attacks and educates them on commonly used techniques.

Description:
The goal of this project is to conduct a realistic phishing campaign targeting employees of "Some Fake Bank." 
The campaign involves sending email templates that resemble legitimate communications from the company's security team, prompting users to update their login credentials. 
A custom landing page, designed to mimic the bank's login portal, is used to collect user credentials and showcase the techniques employed by real-world attackers.

Tools Used:

Gophish: A software platform used to orchestrate the phishing campaign, track user interactions, and collect data.
HTML/CSS Templates: Pre-existing templates sourced from online platforms were customized for the email and landing page design.
Additional Tips:
To effectively track user interactions and analyze campaign performance, enable the "keep credentials" option in Gophish. 
This allows for easier identification of endpoints that interacted with the phishing campaign email. 
Data analytics tools can be utilized to uncover any trends or patterns in the collected data.

Note:
Downloading the required files through the terminal using the Bash command can simplify the setup process.
